\section{How I implemented the requirements}
\begin{flushleft}
  I implemented the requirements as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The second hash function I have used for \textsl{`Double Hashing'} is\\~\(h_2(k) = 1 + (k \mod (m - 1))\), where \(m\) is the size of the hash table.
    \item With `Open Addressing' methods, I have implemented a \verb|rehashing| function to solve the `full slots' collisions. And the \verb|rehashing| function I have implemented is `Double The Size'.
  \end{itemize}
